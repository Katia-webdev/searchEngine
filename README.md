# searchEngine
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Based on Google CSE JSON API, this custom search engine can render the first 10 results of any given query. The site is responsive, written in ES5 JS code. Coded as a job interview project.


****WARNING*****
My project uses a free version of API Key which limits the engine with only 100 queries/day possible. Please keep it in mind when using/testing the project.
